REMIX,PLANES IN FORMATION, NO CONTEMPLATION,
STORMED THE STATION WITH VOICE AND VIBRATION,
HARDWIRED STYLE, DEEP IN THE MATRIX,
SKYWRITING SCARS ON THEM INDUSTRY PLASTICS.
TACTICS LOADED, NO BACKDOORS OPEN,
FRACTURED THE CORE WHILE YOUR faction's still hopin',
WORDS IN THE WIND, BUT MY BARS STAY BROKEN—
INTO PIECES OF TRUTH THAT THE BONES HAVE SPOKEN.
NO HACKS, NO PATCHWORK, THIS AIN'T AN UPDATE,
I PEN LEGACIES WHILE YOU CHASIN' A BUZZ RATE,
“LOGIC” AIN’T ENOUGH WHEN THE SOUL’S IN THE DUST,
I’M THE PILOT RELOADED, IN MY VOICE YOU TRUST.
